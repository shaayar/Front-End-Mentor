## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS 
  - Flexbox properties


### What I learned

There are multiple ways in css to center a div tag, like using the display property, applying padding or margin to div, etc. Here I learned how to center a div tag through margin property in css.

For the code of margin property, see below:
```css
div {
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```
As we apply the above code to any div tag, the div gets the upper and lower margins as '0'
and left and right margin as 'auto'.

### Useful resources

- [QR Code Component | Frontend Mentor Challenge](https://youtu.be/5BBYPntB-GY?si=qyVwFgIm0db5wCVZ) - This helped me for understanding the margin property a bit better. And I also got some knowledge on how to write the code in a proper format through observing the coding pattern. I will use the pattern on going forward in  further projects.
